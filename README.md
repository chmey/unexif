unExif is a program completely written in Java to remove EXIF meta data such as geo-tags from photos.

You may choose between overwriting the EXIF data of a photo and saving the photo to another location excluding the meta data.

Please report any bugs:

You may either compile the program yourself from the included source or run the executable JAR-file.
